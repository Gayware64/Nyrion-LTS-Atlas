**What is Nyrion LTS Nebula?**

Nyrion LTS Nebula is the Long-Term Support (LTS) version of the Nyrion command-line shell, built on the stable 1.3.1 release. It serves as a reliable foundation while newer versions of Nyrion continue to evolve.

This LTS branch exists to:

- Preserve a stable and functional core

- Keep getting updates and new features

Although this version is locked to a stable base, future updates and features will still be addedâ€”carefully and without breaking core functionality. The goal is to extend the shell while keeping it clean, reliable, and useful for long-term users.<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="ChatGPT Image Jul 23, 2025, 07_39_10 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e391040c-8d1d-46d2-9364-6b219052c940" />
