**What is Nyrion LTS Atlas?**

Nyrion LTS Atlas is the Long-Term Support (LTS) version of the Nyrion command-line shell, built on the stable 1.1.3 release. It serves as a reliable foundation while newer versions of Nyrion continue to evolve. Now that Nyrion 2.0 Released, This is the best of Nyrions CLI (1.0 to 1.3.1) It contains all the the good commands from the early Nyrion versions. And I also migrated it to LTAcore. Which makes the old commands even easier and more stable then ever. 

This LTS branch exists to:

- Preserve a stable and functional core

- Keep getting updates and new features

  **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS**
  - Windows 7 or higher
  - Any Linux Distro
  - MacOS is not officialy supported but might work
  - Tkinter (For .py)

Although this version is locked to a stable base, future updates and features will still be addedâ€”carefully and without breaking core functionality. The goal is to extend the shell while keeping it clean, reliable, and useful for long-term users.<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="ChatGPT Image Jul 23, 2025, 07_39_10 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e391040c-8d1d-46d2-9364-6b219052c940" />
